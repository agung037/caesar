## Short Description
Caesar Cipher is a classic cryptographic algorithm that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages or military tactics. Caesar cipher is also known as a shift cipher because the letters in the plaintext are replaced by other letters in certain positions in the alphabetical order. At that time, Julius shifted 3 letters.

example :
```
Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
```
Deciphering is done in reverse, with a right shift of 3.
